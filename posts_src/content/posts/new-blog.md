I've read about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for a while and finally decided to
give it a try.  I'm not a big blogger, so my initial use case to apply it to
is for a knowledge base, which is hosted at http://amcpu.org/kb.  I'll mostly
be posting links to articles that I find interesting on that site and maybe
post some simple walkthroughs periodically.
